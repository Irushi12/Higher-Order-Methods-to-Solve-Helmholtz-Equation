# Higher-Order-Methods-to-Solve-Helmholtz-Equation
This Repository contains my master's thesis work on Fourth Order and Sixth Order Methods to Solve 1D and 2D Helmholtz Equations with large wavenumbers.
## 1D Helmholtz Equation
To solve 1D Helmholtz equation, six direct methods and six iterative methods are developed.
### Direct Methods
1. CM-4-DM
2. CM-6-DM
3. CM-6-BC4-DM
4. CCM-4-DM
5. CCM-6-DM
6. CCM-6-BC4-DM
### Iterative Methods
1. CM-4-CG
2. CM-6-CG
3. CM-6-BC4-CG
4. CCM-4-CG
5. CCM-6-CG
6. CCM-6-BC4-CG

## 2D Helmholtz Equation
To solve 2D Helmholtz equation, three direct methods and six iterative methods are developed.
### Direct Methods
